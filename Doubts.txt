1) We have a list of pointers of derived class. I need to call some function only for a particular type.
   What is the best way to do that? If its possible, the marker can be in DE list

2) const_cast<DrawElement*>(dr)->setHighlighted(); 

3) getPlayer(), setPlayer(). Are getters/setters needed here? We're not encapsulating anything here right?
